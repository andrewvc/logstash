=== Changes in Logstash Core

These changes can impact any instance of Logstash and are plugin agnostic, but only if you are using the features that are impacted.

[float]
==== Application Settings

* The setting `config.reload.interval` has been changed to use time value strings such as `5m`, `10s` etc.
  Previously, users had to convert this to a millisecond time value themselves.

[float]
==== RPM/Deb package changes

* For `rpm` and `deb` release artifacts, config files that match the `*.conf` glob pattern must be in the conf.d folder, 
  or the files will not be loaded. If there are non-configuration files in this folder this can be problematic.

[float]
==== Command Line Interface behavior

* The `-e` and `-f` CLI options are now mutually exclusive. This also applies to the corresponding long form options `config.string` and
  `path.config`. This means any configurations  provided via `-e` will no longer be appended to the configurations provided via `-f`.
* Configurations provided with `-f` or `config.path` will not be appended with `stdin` input and `stdout` output automatically.

[float]
=== Plugin Changes

Note that the list of plugins included with Logstash has changed. Please check that the new plugin list still includes all plugins you use.

[float]
==== Elasticsearch output changes

* The default `document_type` has changed from `logs` to `doc` for consistency with Beats.
  Furthermore, users are advised that Elasticsearch 6.0 deprecates doctypes, and 7.0 will remove them. 
  See https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/removal-of-types.html[Removal of Mapping Types] for more info.
* The options `flush_size` and `idle_flush_time` are now obsolete.
* Please note that the https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.0/mapping-all-field.html[_all] field is deprecated in 6.0.
 The new mapping template has been updated to reflect that. If you are using a custom mapping template you may need to update it to reflect that.

[float]
==== Kafka input changes

* Upgraded Kafka client support to v0.11.0.0, which only supports Kafka brokers v0.10.x or later.
** Please refer to <<plugins-inputs-kafka,Kafka input plugin>> documentation for information about Kafka compatibility with Logstash.
* Decorated fields are now nested under `@metadata` to avoid mapping conflicts with Beats.
** See the `Metadata Fields` section in the <<plugins-inputs-kafka,Kafka input plugin>> documentation for more details.
* The `ssl` option is now obsolete.

[float]
==== Kafka output changes

* Upgraded Kafka client support to v0.11.0.0, which only supports Kafka brokers v0.10.x or later.
** Please refer to <<plugins-outputs-kafka,Kafka output plugin>> documentation for information about Kafka compatibility with Logstash.
* The options `block_on_buffer_full`, `ssl`, and `timeout_ms` are now obsolete.

[float]
==== Beats input changes

* Logstash will no longer start when <<plugins-codecs-multiline,Multiline codec plugin>> is used with the Beats input plugin.
** It is recommended to use the multiline support in Filebeat as a replacement - see https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/multiline-examples.html[configuration options available in Filebeat] for details.
* The options `congestion_threshold` and `target_field_for_codec` are now obsolete.

[float]
=== TCP Input Changes
* Changed the behaviour of the host field to contain the resolved peer hostname for a connection instead of its peer IP.
* Removed the `data_timeout` and `ssl_cacert` options because they are now obsolete.
* Moved the peer's IP to the new field `ip_address`.

[float]
=== TCP Output Changes
* Breaking: removed the `message_format` option because it is now obsolete.

[float]
=== SQS Output Changes
* Breaking: removed the `batch` and `batch_timeout` options because they are now obsolete.

[float]
=== Redis Output Changes
* Removed the `name` and `queue` options because they are now obsolete.

[float]
=== RabbitMQ Input/Output Changes
* Removed the `debug`, `tls_certificate_path`, and `tls_certificate_password` options because they are now obsolete.

[float]
=== Logstash Output HTTP
* Removed the `ssl_certificate_verify` option because it is now obsolete.

[float]
=== Logstash Input HTTP Poller
* Removed the `ssl_certificate_verify` option because it is now obsolete.

[float]
=== GeoIP Changes
* Removed the `lru_cache_size` option because it is now obsolete.

[float]
=== CEF Codec Changes
* Removed the `sev` and `deprecated_v1_fields` options because they are now obsolete.
